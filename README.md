A Spring Boot project that demonstrates secure user authentication using OAuth2 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This application provides a robust foundation for handling user login, registration, and token-based authorization.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ User Registration & Login
- ✅ JWT Token Generation & Validation
- ✅ OAuth2 Authentication Support
- ✅ Spring Security Integration
- ✅ Secure REST APIs
- ✅ Role-based Authorization
- ✅ Built using Spring Boot & JPA

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Security**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **OAuth2**
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
- **H2 / MySQL** (Pluggable Database Support)
- **Maven**

## 🔐 How It Works

1. User registers or logs in via REST API.
2. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated.
3. This token is returned to the client and used for all subsequent API calls.
4. Spring Security filters validate the token and authorize access to secured endpoints.
